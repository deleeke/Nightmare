The receptionist is unfazed,
-
opens up their shirt to reveil a dart gun,
-
pulls it out and shoots you with a medicated dart.
-
everything goes dark,
-
and you wake up under a bright light.
-
You can hear voices talking but you cannot move.
-
They say, "Increase sedation, we can't have them
wiggling around as we cut into the skull,
we don't want to endager our brain material, now do we?"
