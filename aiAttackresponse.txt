You lash out but your arms dissolve into dust :0
Your efforts are futile
Your uncle bursts out of their chest with a dead octopus and attacks you
You reach out to attack, but then your arm falls off!
You suddenly realize you're a naked puppy!
You suddenly realize you need to call your mom!
You suddenly realize your hair is made of spiders!
You try to move but you feel as though you are tied down.
