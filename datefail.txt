The skin on your date's forehead begins to writhe, as if there
was something under the skin.
-
Then, bloodlessly, it begins to part like a banana peel.
-
You try and scream but no noise comes out.
-
The skin continues to part, revealing the head of a boar.
-
It drools and glares at you, snorting
-
Its huge lower teeth jut out, and drool drips down as it snorts.
You feel as though you are tied to your chair and you can't move!
-
It sloughs off the 'human skin' and lunges across the table,
jaw wide open to devour you!!!
